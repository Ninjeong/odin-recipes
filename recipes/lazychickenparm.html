        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Turn on the oven's broiler and set a rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
                Slice ciabatta roll in half. Butter cut sides and sprinkle with garlic powder. Place
                on a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Broil in the oven until just toasted golden brown 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from
                the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Layer 2 slices of deli chicken on both sides. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over
                chicken on 1 half, then spoon marinara sauce on the other half.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return to the oven and broil until cheese is melted and sauce is heated through,
                about 5 minutes. Remove and sprinkle with parmesan cheese, then close the
                sandwich halves together. Serve with additional marinara warmed to taste.
