# odin-recipes
First website to practice HTML knowledge that will display links to various recipes. Will revisit later to style up with CSS.
This should display my skills at writing html boilerplates, practicing elements and tags, working with text, creating lists
unordered and ordered, and embedding links and images.

I also need to practice committing good messages and how often I should be doing so.
